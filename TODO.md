## TODO
- collision (circles only), pushing...
- pathfinding/steering
- unit ID (or something) to check against when referencing other units (e.g. target), so we don't have problems reusing entity slots
- dying by falling off bridge (?)
- maybe fail to spawn if not enough room...?
- show weapon, some kind of anim
- health bars
    - appear when hit, fade after a second or so
