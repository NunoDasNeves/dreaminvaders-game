## TODO
- make units push each other less; especially friendlies - maybe separation force?
- export sprites faster - created flipped version with exporter script
- add another unit type for testing, actual placeholder graphics for it
- display unit types on bottom of screen
- select unit type with numbers (don't hardcode) - or just press the button to send the unit on the current lane
- for debugging, cycle team with some button (TAB or something)
- unit acceleration instead of instant velocity change
- don't randomize placement; place at a specific distance, on spot closest to mouse ?
- better collision? pushing...impulse?
- better steering/avoidance?
    - deal with avoidance conflict (they avoid the same way)?
    - use velocity to determine how far ahead to look
        - use other boids velocity to determine where they'll be
    - capsule doesn't work well, use a half circle (circle and then only consider stuff in front)

## Done
- basic perf counters - fps and updates per frame
- basic animation - unit walk cycle
- load placeholder graphics for testing
- Make the layout look more like the concept art
- 'lighthouse' (unit?) with hp. Units are 'spent' when they go inside, and reduces the hp
- units ignore others when on the last leg to the lighthouse
- stop attacking or chasing enemies that are on the last leg to go into the lighthouse
- click on lane to place unit (don't hardcode)
    - place on closest lane
- add additional lanes! curves! bezier! probably!
    - units need to follow the lane properly without falling off
- dying by falling off bridge
- death animation, unit can hang around after death and not be targetted
- 'hit' effect - flash red or something
- health bars
    - appear when hit, fade after a second or so
- show little stabby/triangle weapon on attack aim/swing/recover
- table boids stuff for now, basic collision is ok!
- split stuff into modules; render, update, (static) data, (game) state
- unit ID (or something) to check against when referencing other units (e.g. target), so we don't have problems reusing entity slots
- basic avoidance
- SIMPLE collision
- fail to spawn if not enough room
