## TODO
- display player/s resource count/s
- resources go up over time
- making a unit uses resources
    - debug option to increase resources
- support multiple player types? keeping in mind scenarios EvE, PvE, PvP (local), PvP (remote)...(to some degree)
- armor
- more weapon types - AOE, projectile, visual effects (tracer, missed attack etc)
- debug display: how long an update() takes
- display unit types on bottom of screen
- fix resolution; default camera scale should look the best
- units slow down/stop when path is blocked, before colliding and sliding off the bridge (while proceeding)
- better collision or AI for collision
    - less jittering/bouncing
    - support pushing (when we want it) - use unit mass or something
- better steering/avoidance?
    - deal with avoidance conflict (they avoid the same way)?
    - use velocity to determine how far ahead to look
        - use other boids velocity to determine where they'll be
    - capsule doesn't work well, use a half circle (circle and then only consider stuff in front)

## Done
- separate concept of 'team' for identifying friend/foe, and 'color' for rendering - they could diverge!
- improve collision...remove velocity normal to collision
- dont fall off edge when chasing or proceeding (as much)
- unit come to a stop in attack range, instead of trying to get really close (try just increasing the range a tad first)
- make units push each other less; especially friendlies - maybe separation force?
- unit acceleration instead of instant velocity change
- for debugging, cycle team with some button (TAB or something)
- select unit type with keys - just press the button to send the unit on the current lane
- export sprites faster - created flipped version with exporter script
- add another unit type for testing, actual placeholder graphics for it
- basic perf counters - fps and updates per frame
- basic animation - unit walk cycle
- load placeholder graphics for testing
- Make the layout look more like the concept art
- 'lighthouse' (unit?) with hp. Units are 'spent' when they go inside, and reduces the hp
- units ignore others when on the last leg to the lighthouse
- stop attacking or chasing enemies that are on the last leg to go into the lighthouse
- click on lane to place unit (don't hardcode)
    - place on closest lane
- add additional lanes! curves! bezier! probably!
    - units need to follow the lane properly without falling off
- dying by falling off bridge
- death animation, unit can hang around after death and not be targetted
- 'hit' effect - flash red or something
- health bars
    - appear when hit, fade after a second or so
- show little stabby/triangle weapon on attack aim/swing/recover
- table boids stuff for now, basic collision is ok!
- split stuff into modules; render, update, (static) data, (game) state
- unit ID (or something) to check against when referencing other units (e.g. target), so we don't have problems reusing entity slots
- basic avoidance
- SIMPLE collision
- fail to spawn if not enough room
